The BiblesInternational package contains various resources for Bibledit-Desktop
such as cross-reference datasets (.crf files) and keyterm files.

I also have an experimental dataset of repeated phrases that might be useful
for translators to reduce duplicated work.

What are all these files?

Cross-Reference Data
--------------------
bi.txt        - cross reference data, text format, saved from MS Word
bi.crf        - result of linux/buildcrf.pl bi.txt; binary file
bilongcrf.txt - result of linux/readcrf.pl bi.crf
	        This is mainly useful for debugging.
open_bible_info_crf.txt - Open Bible cross reference data file.
			Source: https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/

open_bible_info.crf - result of linux/buildcrf_openxrefs.pl; binary file
open_bible_info_longcrf.txt - result of linux/readcrf.pl open_bible_info.crf
			    This is mainly useful for debugging.
Makefile.am   - Autotools Makefile template that tells how to install
                the cross-reference data file (bi.crf is the only one at
                the moment). If you change this, run autoconf, automake,
                and then ./configure in the bibledit-desktop directory.
repeated_phrases.py - script to generate the next file. Run this on
		      http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10/pg10.txt
phrasesN.txt  - phrases of N or more words in KJV that repeat
repeated_phrases.rpf - repeated phrase file, binary encoded version of above

Key Terms Data
--------------------
BI_OT_Keyterms_X.txt - BI's OT key terms list, subset for the book(s) X
BI_NT_Keyterms_X.txt - BI's NT key terms list, subset for the book(s) X
BI_NT_Keyterms.txt   - all of BI's NT key terms, no subsetting
BI_OT_Keyterms.txt   - all of BI's OT key terms, no subsetting
fixKeyTerms.pl       - eventually will adjust key term versifications
fixOTKeyterms1.txt   - eventually will tell how to adjust verse numbers of
                       where versification is needing adjustment
makeKeyTermSets.sh   - uses reduceKeyTerms.pl a number of times to generate
                       various subsets of keyterms
reduceKeyTerms.pl    - Take full key term list and pare it down to just those
		       references in a given book or set of books spec'd on the
		       command line.
makeKeyTermSets.log  - log file of the above .sh script
